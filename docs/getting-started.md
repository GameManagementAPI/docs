# Getting Started
Welcome to the GameManagementAPI documentation!

## What is GameManagementAPI?
GMA is a powerful and flexible game infrastructure library for Minecraft plugin developers.

GMA provides a comprehensive set of systems that handle the repetitive and complex foundation most game plugins require, allowing developers to focus purely on gameplay logic instead of boilerplate infrastructure.

## How this documentation works
This documentation is split into the major sections that build up GMA. It's been designed in such a way that it should be easy to find exactly what you want to help you get started with the library, and how to make effective use of it.

You can use the sidebar on the left to access the various sections of the documentation.
